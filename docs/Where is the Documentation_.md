# Where is the Documentation?
The NuPattern toolset installs extensive and integrated (offline) documentation used to explain building and working with Pattern Toolkits. This documentation includes: a User's Guide, and Builder's Guide. The guides cover topics like: why toolkits are needed? how to run them? how to built them? and how can they be extended and customized?
This guidance is both informational and instructional and is contained within the extensions installed with NuPattern. 
* The product documentation for NuPattern is installed by installing the 'NuPattern Toolkit Builder' extension, and can be seen in [Visual Studio](#installed), and also [Online](#online)
* The documents for the NuPattern project itself are also [Online](#online)

# {anchor:installed}View the Documentation in Visual Studio

![](Where is the Documentation?_Guidance Windows.png)
The extensions above install a copy of the guidance (as an volume of *.MHT files, one file for each topic). This is how the 'Guidance Workflow Explorer' tool window consumes each topic when viewed in Visual Studio. 
If you are interested in the individual topics, you can find these MHT documents in the installation folders of the extensions themselves. For Visual Studio 2010, those can be found under: %localappdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\_vsver_\Extensions\Microsoft\_extension_

# {anchor:online}View the Documentation Online
If you want to browse the documentation outside of Visual Studio, we have including the compiled and indexed PDF versions of the guidance in PDF documents that can be browsed and printed.

Please download those PDFs from the [latest released version](https://nupattern.codeplex.com/releases).

Note: At some point in the future, this documentation will be hosted online.
