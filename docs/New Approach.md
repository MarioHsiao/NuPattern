# A New Approach

_Let's say that you have mastered building web applications on the ASP.NET MVC framework in Visual Studio, and you want to continue to leverage your investment in that framework and technology. Over the course of mastering this technology and building various web sites you have learned the hard way what works and what doesn't, and where the gaps in the tooling and technology are. You have undoubtedly created some libraries and discovered implementation patterns that solve the kinds of problems your organization or community have faced in building your kinds of web apps. You are constantly refining the best way to build these applications, and make them more robust. Now, you need to enforce those patterns and practices in your organization for those who may not have the mastery of the framework that you do._ 
_Ideally, you'd like to have your own tools and automation that help ensure that others build the software the way you have proven it to be done reliably, but such tools and standards don't exist yet. You might resort to documenting your wisdom and guidelines painstakingly hoping someone will pay attention to them, but realise no one wants to read your document especially as you are constantly evolving it. What you really want are evolving tools that you can share with them that they can use in their solution that apply the practices for them consistently, and far quicker. So that they can focus on other more interesting aspects of the software. But you imagine building such tools is too complicated and will take too much of your time and effort, and mastering Visual Studio Extensibility is something you really don't relish to experience._

NuPattern is the answer. In a few hours, you can have your own custom toolkit up and running in Visual Studio that applies your wisdom and guidelines for others in your organization. These tools will create and manage the moving parts in a solution, and write and structure the code your way. If things change, no problem, you or someone else simply updates the toolkit to do that thing better and automatically your solution is corrected - no source code required!

NuPattern allows you to combine: automation, guidance, templates and reusable assets that accelerate the development and deployment of more reliable, maintainable and higher quality software solutions.

         _"Never before have tools with this magnitude of power and flexibility been available to all IT experts to capture and share their expertise"_

## Pattern Toolkits - What are they?
A **'Pattern Toolkit'** is a self-contained set of purpose-built tools that orchestrates automation and instructional guidance to help other engineers apply their best practices to their custom solution development/deployment work consistently and reliably. Anyone can build and use these 'Pattern Toolkits' as part of their normal development/deployment work so that any organization/community can begin to automate areas of their work where the organization/community has already established guidelines or proven solutions for their projects.

Pattern Toolkits are typically built by development or deployment experts who have advanced knowledge in proven solution implementation, or have developed best practices in development and deployment for use by a specific organization/community.

### Who should USE Pattern Toolkits?
* You are new to a software development/deployment organization/community
* You are new to a technology/architecture/coding pattern
* You want to leverage established and proven best practices when you build or deploy your solutions
* Your organization/community has determined some best practices and ways of developing or deploying their solutions, and you want to continue to enact them consistently
* You want to be more proficient and faster with a new technology/architecture/coding pattern
* You want to be more productive in your custom development work/re-work

If you are a IT Professional (you build or deploy IT solutions) and you are looking to build and deploy custom solutions that include proven best practices to improve quality, consistency and time to market. And if you wish to spend significantly less time having to learn all the intricacies and technical details of how to build, solve, integrate and deploy complex technologies and solutions for your specific needs. Then you want to leverage the expertise of others who dedicate themselves to solving these kinds of problems for solutions like yours, so you can be far more productive - then you need to start asking for and using ‘Pattern Toolkits’ to help you to do your stuff.

### Who should BUILD Pattern Toolkits?
* You have expertise in software development/deployment that you want to share in your organization/community
* You wish to demonstrate a best practice/proven practice or solution
* You wish to enforce best practices with a new platform/technology/architecture
* You wish to establish a standard way of solving problems within your organization/community with best practices by creating automation

If you are an IT expert (you lead others in building or deploying IT solutions) and you have proven expertise in implementing and delivering custom solutions or technologies, and you wish to share your knowledge and expertise with your team/community/partners or across projects/communities. Then you need to build tooling and automation that others can use to apply your expertise. NuPattern provides a new way to capture, communicate, and deploy your best practices, coded/scripted solutions, architectural or technology patterns, with others that is instructional, configurable and customizable - by building Pattern Toolkits.
